; INI style File
;
; This file describes the properties of the active medium 
; (volume recombination rate, ion mobilites, electron mobilities, electron attachment rate, 
; electron-ion recombination rate, permittivity).
;
; Comment lines starting with ; are ignored.
; Any ammount of blank lines can be added.
;
; Every properties has a section (in []) naming the property.
; In each section a function is defined (contant, line, exp, ploly4, poly5 or spline) in dependence of the electric field strength,
; with the electric field strength given in V/cm.
; For a spline a file_name pointing to the location of a file containing the parameters of the spline should be given
; (relative paths are relative to the run directory).
; The other functions are defined by parameters: param0, param1 etc.
;
; constant: 		 y = param0
; line:     		 y = param0 + param1*x
; expontential-function: y = param0 + param1*exp(param2*x)
; polynom 4. order: 	 y = param0 + param1*x + param2*x*x..., expects 5 parameters (param0 param1 param2 ...)
; polynom 5. order: 	 y = param0 + param1*x + param2*x*x..., expects 6 parameters (param0 param1 param2 ...)
; spline: The spline file contains 2 header lines and a body of 4 columns of tab-seperated values
;	The tab seperated values are the coefficients of third order polynomials, each for a specific interval of electric 
;	field values.
;	The first header line: Number_of_splines: 18 Min_X_Spacing: 50
;	gives the number of lines in the table (i.e., polynomial intervals) and 
;	the largest common denominator of those intervals .
;	The second line: Knots: 50	200	400	etc.
;	specifies the E-field intervals. It is a tab seperated list of values, denominating the boundaries of intervals.
;	The first polynomial is used for the interval 50-200, the second for 200-400 etc.
;	See the given files for an example.
;
; Order within one section and of the sections is irrelevant.
