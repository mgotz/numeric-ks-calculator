; comment line staring with ; are ignored

;
; every properties has a section (in [])
; in each section a function is defined (contant, line, exp, ploly4, poly5 or spline)
; for a spline a file_name pointing to the location of a file containing the parameters of the spline should be given
; the other function are defined by parameters: param0, param1 etc.
;
; expontential-function: [0]+[1]*exp([2]*x)
; polynom 4. order: [0]+[1]*x+[2]*x*x..., expects 5 parameters ([0] [1] [2]...)
; polynom 5. order: [0]+[1]*x+[2]*x*x..., expects 6 parameters ([0] [1] [2]...)
; spline: The spline file contains 2 header lines and a body of 4 columns of tab-seperated values
;	the tab seperated values are the coefficients of third order polynomials, each for a specific interval of electic field values
;	the first header line: Number_of_splines: 18 Min_X_Spacing: 50
;	informs about the number of lines in the table and the largest common denominator of the intervals 
;	the second line: Knots: 50	200	400	etc.
;	informs about the E-field intervals. It is a tab seperated list of values.
;	the first polynomials is used for the interval 50-200, the second for 200-400 etc.
;	see the given files for an example.
;
; order within one section and of the sections is irrelevant
